  <h3> Required Items: Goron Mask and Powder Keg </h3>
  <h3> Reward: Epona, Epona's Song and Empty Bottle </h3>

  <h3> Mission <h3>
    <ul type="square">
      <li> On the first day, use a Powder Keg to blow up the rock blocking the way to Romani Ranch.
      You can obtain access to this through the main quest. </li>
      <li> Talk to the small girl next to the balloon and she will teach you Epona's Song and tell 
      you to come back later that night. </li>
       <li> At 2:30AM come back to the ranch to defend the house from aliens, which will be until 5AM. 
       Play the inverted song to slow down time, making the mission much easier. </li>
       <li> The easiest strategy for this is riding around the house shooting aliens when they get close. 
       Pay attention to the dog, as it will bark at the closest alien. </li>
       <li> Once you are done, you will get a bottle of milk as well as access to Epona. </li>
    </ul>
