  <h3> Mission <h3>
    <ul type="square">
      <li> Go to the Treasure Chest Shop in East Clock Town and ask to play the game while wearing the Goron Mask. </li>
      <li> You then have a set amount of time to get to the treasure chest in the room. </li>
      <li> Hint: This game is very luck based but a semi-reliable method is starting from the far left corner and hugging the wall
      to the left, until you hit a dead end or the chest. If you hit a dead end, just keep following the wall, taking a left
      whenever you can. If you follow this method and you should get to the chest. </li> 
      <li> Once you reach the chest, you will get a Heart Piece. </li> 
    </ul>
