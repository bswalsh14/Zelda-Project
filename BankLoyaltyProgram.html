  <h3> Required Items: 5000 Rupees </h3>
  <h3> Reward: Adult Wallet and a Heart Piece </h3>

  <h3> Mission <h3>
    <ul type="square">
      <li> Deposit 200 Rupees to the banker located behind the clock tower, across from the save point, to get an Adult Wallet. </li>
      <li> Deposit 5000 Rupees to get a Heart Piece. </li>
      <li> Hint: Fight the weird looking bird outside the South Clock Town entrance, right before the gate to Milk Road. 
      It will drop 200 Rupees per kill, but be careful as it can steal your items (including your sword).
      If this happens just play the Song of Time to get everything back. </li>
    </ul>
